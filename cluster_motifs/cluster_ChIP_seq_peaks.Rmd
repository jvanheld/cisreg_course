## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you already learned the theory in the following chapters.


| Chapter | Slides |

## Tools used in this tutorial


| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| [RSAT](http://teaching.rsat.eu/) matrix-clustering | Separate a collection of input PSSMs in separated clusters and display these clusters in different representations (Tree + Heatmap). |
| [RSAT](http://teaching.rsat.eu/) compare-matrices | Compare a query collection of motifs versus a target collection of motifs, using several dis(similarity) metrics. |

## Tutorial - Reduce motif redundancy after motif discovery in ChIP-seq peaks

1. [Download](https://github.com/jvanheld/cisreg_course/tree/gh-pages/cluster_motifs/data) a set of matrices that were found with *peak-motifs* in a set of ChIP-seq peaks for the TF **Oct4**.  

1. Open a connection to the **Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools** [teaching server](http://teaching.rsat.eu/) ([http://teaching.rsat.eu/](http://teaching.rsat.eu/)).

2. In the left-side menu, open the tool set **Matrix tools**, and click on **matrix-clustering**.

3. **Analysis Title**: Write the name of the analysis in the **Title** box. E.g. 'Oct4 motifs from ChIP-seq peaks'.

4. **Matrices**: Paste the matrices in the **Matrix** box, and check that the input format is set to **transfac**.

5. **Collection Name**: (Optional) Give a collection name to all the motifs of this collection. E.g. 'Oct4 ChIPseq'.

6. **Threshold**: Click on the section **Thresholds to define the cluster** and set the next values in the **lower threshold** column. **Ncor** : 0.6 ; **cor** : 0.4 ; **w** : 5.

7. **Metric to build the tree**: Select one metric that will be used to build the hierarchical tree. Select --> **Ncor**.

8. **Linkage method**: Select one linkage method to group the motifs. Select -->  **Average**.

9. **Output file options**: Select -->  **Heatmap**. Let empty the other boxes.

10. **Labels displayed in logo tree**: Select -->  **Names**. Let empty the other boxes.

11. Click on **GO** (This analysis takes around 1 minute).

## *matrix-clustering* report

1. The *matrix-clustering* report is divided in several section that you can hide/show.

2. **Results Summary**: a small table showing the input parameters and the number of input motifs and clusters found.

3. **Clusters Summary**: a table showing the Familal Binding Profiles **FBP** of each cluster and the name and the number of the motifs grouped for each cluster.

4. **Logo Forest**: all the cluster are represented as a forest (set of trees). Each tree is dynamic (Click on the nodes to collapse/expand them).

5. **Individual Motif View**: a table showing the description of each input motif.

6. **Individual Cluster View**: analyze each cluster individually. Click on the number at each tree branch to select it and display a table with its corresponding **FBP**.

7. **Heatmap View**: A heatmap showing the (dis)similarities among all the motifs. Each cluster is indicates with a color bar (which is the same color used for the trees in the *Logo Forest*).

8. **Additional Files**: A list of complementary files.

* * * 

* * * 

## Analysis

1. The selection of non-redundant motifs will be done during the session.

## Playing with PSSM

### Download a matrix from footprintDB

1. Open a connection to [footprintDB](http://floresta.eead.csic.es/footprintdb/) ([http://floresta.eead.csic.es/footprintdb/](http://floresta.eead.csic.es/footprintdb/))
2. In the menu on the left site, click **Databases**
3. Select one transcription factor of your choice (one different per student).
4. Download the binding sites. 
5. Download the DNA binding motif.
6. Note about matrix formats


- convert matrix between tab-delimited and stamp-transfac (footprintDB) and transfac


### Take-home message

1. Logos
2. Impact of the number of sites. Error bars on the logos
3. Interpretation and impact of the pseudo-weight. 


# Scanning sequences to predict TF binding sites

- Select a motif from footprintDB / RegulonDB collection
- get the matrix + consensus 
- Scan all the promoters from E.coli

    - with a strict consensus
    - with degenerate consensus
    - with the PSSM

- check if you recovered the annotated binding sites
- evaluate the number of predicted sites


# Matrix comparison and clustering

- Enter with a motif in footprintDB and compare it with the whole database ("search"" form)
- The same but restrict to a specific organism
- matrix-clustering demo + exercises (Jaime)

# To do

## convert-matrix (Jacques)

- check that the matrices downloaded from footprintDB can be converted (including name)
- test the STAMP format OK
- aparently the footprintDB format is a hybrid between stamp and transfac -> add it explicitly in the convert-matrix input formats 
- convert-matrix: fix the problem with frequency matrices which appear as flat logos with huge error bars

- convert-matrix: produce colored consensus in HTML format

## footprintDB (sugerencias, wish list para mas tarde)

- coloracion de los consensus: import colored consensus sfrom convert-matrices
- include sequence of binding sites in the export format if it exists. Note that this makes HUGE files for matrices derived form ChIP-seq -> to be evaluated
- links "Binding sites" currently give all the binding sites for all the TF. Could you adda column with the TF name and/or enable to select binding sites per matrix
