## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will attempt to predict cis-regulatory motifs for a set of genes of interest, based on the discovery of conserved motifs in the promoters of their orthologs (***phylogenetic footprints***). This aproach was proposed in the end of the 1990's, when a few genomes only were available. With the ever-increasing speed and ever-decreasing costs of sequencing projects, the number of completely sequenced genomes follows an exponential growth, and the power of comparative genomics methods increases accordingly. 

The anlaysis of phylogenetic footprints is particularly fruitful in small genomes (Bacteria, Fungi), where cis-regulatory elements are located in delimited regions circumscribed to a few hundred base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. 



## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you already learned the theory in the following chapters.

## Tutorial


### Getting the list of target genes for your transcription factor of interest

1. Open a connection to the [RegulonDB](http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/)
2. Enter the name of your transcription factor of interest in the **Search** box. Below the *Regulon* title, click on the link **Transcription factor id**.
3. Copy the list of regulated genes, and paste them in a text file. Replace the commas by newline character, in order to obtain a file with one row per target gene for your transcription factor. 

### Getting putative orthologs (BBH) for your transcription factor of interest

In a first time, we will identify the genomes in which your transcription factor of interest has a putative ortholog. We use a somewhat rudimentary (but pragmatic) approach to identify putative ortholog, by selecting the bidirectional best hits (BBH). 

4. Open a connexion to the [RSAT teaching server](http://teaching.rsat.eu/). 
5. In the **Comparative genomics** tools, open the **get-orthologs** form.
6. Type the name of your transcription factor in the **Query** box, and select a **taxon**. In a first time we recommend to select the class (*Enterobacteriales*), but this can then be modified to compare the results obtained at different taxonomic levels.
