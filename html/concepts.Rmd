### Regulon

A regulon is the set of all the genes regulated by a given transcription
factor (e.g. the LexA regulon).

### Operon

An operon is a set of genes transcribed in a single transcription unit.
A transcription unit comprizing several coding sequences is qualified of
polycistronic.

Operons are very frequent in Bacteria, where they usually regroup sets
of genes involved in a same biological process (e.g. the his operon
contains the genes required to code for all the enzymes of histidine
biosynthesis).

In eukaryotes, genes ere generally transcribed as mono-cistronic units
(an mRNA only codes for a single polypeptide). A notable exception if
found in Trypanosoma, where large polycistronic units are transcribed,
which regroup functionally unrelated genes, and regulation occurs
essentially at the post-transcriptional level.

### Evaluation statistics

The statistics defined below are of very wide use in bioinformatics and biomedical sciences. They are used to evaluate the reliability of supervised classification and predictive approaches. In the context of this course, we will consider them under the angle of the prediction: let us assume that we used an approach to predict binding sites -- or target genes -- for a given transcription factor, and we compare the prediction to the "truth", for a dataset that we consider as the golden standard.


| Prediction status | Actual feature<br>(binding site, target gene) | Actual non-feature |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Positive**<br>(predicted as feature) | True positive ($TP$) | False positive ($FP$) | 
| **Negative**<br>(predicted as non-feature) | False negative ($FN$) | True negative ($TN$) | 
| | | | |

These four categories of predictions can in turn serve to define a set of derived statistics, providing complementary insight into the reliability of the predictions. 

| Symbol | Definition | Description | 
|--------|------------|-------------|
| $FP$ | False positive | Actual features (e.g. sites, target genes) predicted as positives |
| $FN$ | False negative | Actual non-features predicted as negatives |
| $TP$ | True positive | Actual features predicted as positives |
| $TN$ | True negative | Actual non-features predicted as negatives |
| $Sn$ | $Sn = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$  | *Sensitivity*: proportion of true positives ($TP$) among the actual features ($TP+FN$).   Also called *coverage*. |
| $PPV$ | $PPV=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ | *Positive predictive value*: proportion of true positives ($TP$) among the predicted features ($TP+FP$).     | 
| $FPR$ | $FPR = \frac{FP}{TN+FP}$ | *False positve rate*: proportion of false positive *under the null model*, i.e. among the actual non-features |
| $FDR$ | $FDR = \frac{FP}{TP+FP} = 1 - PPV$ | *False discovery rate*: proportion of false positive among the features declared positive |
