### Regulon

A regulon is the set of all the genes regulated by a given transcription
factor (e.g. the LexA regulon).

### Operon

An operon is a set of genes transcribed in a single transcription unit.
A transcription unit comprizing several coding sequences is qualified of
polycistronic.

Operons are very frequent in Bacteria, where they usually regroup sets
of genes involved in a same biological process (e.g. the his operon
contains the genes required to code for all the enzymes of histidine
biosynthesis).

In eukaryotes, genes ere generally transcribed as mono-cistronic units
(an mRNA only codes for a single polypeptide). A notable exception if
found in Trypanosoma, where large polycistronic units are transcribed,
which regroup functionally unrelated genes, and regulation occurs
essentially at the post-transcriptional level.

### IUPAC code for ambiguous nucleotides

| Symbol | Nucleotide(s) | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| A | A |  Adenosine |
| C | C |  Cytidine |
| G | G |  Guanosine |
| T | T |  Thymidine |
| R  |  A or G| puRines |
| Y  |  C or T| pYrimidines |
| W  |  A or T| Weak hydrogen bonding |
| S  |  G or C| Strong hydrogen bonding |
| M  |  A or C| aMino group at common position |
| K |   = G or T| Keto group at common position |
| H |   = A, C or T | not G |
| B |   = G, C or T | not A |
| V |   = G, A, C |   not T |
| D |   = G, A or T | not C |
| N |   = G, A, C or T |  aNy |

### Evaluation of predictions



| Symbol | Definition | Description | 
|--------|------------|-------------|
| $FP$ | False positive | Actual features (e.g. sites, target genes) predicted as positives |
| $FN$ | False negative | Non-actual features predicted as negatives |
| $TP$ | True positive | Actual features predicted as positives |
| $TN$ | True negative | Non-actual features predicted as negatives |
| $Sn$ | $Sn = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$  | *Sensitivity*: fraction of true positives ($TP$) among the actual features ($TP+FN$).   Also called *coverage*. |
| $PPV$ | $PPV=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ | *Positive predictive value*: fraction of true positives ($TP$) among the predicted features ($TP+FP$).     |
